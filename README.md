# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe-2-Players
This is a simple implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game in Python for two players - Human vs Human. The game can be played between two players and can be run on any Python environment. Basic Python OOP has been used to build this game.

How to Play
Run the Tic-tac-toe.py file using any Python environment.
The first player will be assigned 'X' as their marker, and the second player will be assigned 'O'.
To make a move, enter the number where you want to place your marker.
```
-------------
| 0 | 1 | 2 |
-------------
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
-------------
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
-------------
```
The game ends when one player gets three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all the spaces on the board are filled.
To restart the game, simply run the tictactoe.py file again.
